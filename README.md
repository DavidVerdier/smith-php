# Heptagon
Heptagon is a lightweight PHP7 framework. It aims at providing the most basic toolset for an application and orienting development towards good practice.
It is currently in very early development and should not be used in this state.

## Planned Features
- Basic route management
- View management with modular Component based content building
- Controller based logic and data implementation
- Database abstraction
- Template engine
- Flexible theme/skin specification
- Automatic and configurable API exposer
- Application Events
- Event based plugin integration
- More to come if new features appear to be necessary ...

### Basic route management
Route management allows us to choose which View to expose depending on the HTTP request and the HTTP verb.
This will allow us to define View rules for (at the very least) the GET, PUT, POST and DELETE verbs.
